        &emsp; Over the course of my academic carrer, I compiled notes on fundamental machine learning concepts.<br>
            &emsp; They are the summary of what I've learned in concise manner, so that anybody (including myself)
            can refresh their knowledge on those important concepts.<br>
            &emsp; Below is the list of notes that I compiled.
